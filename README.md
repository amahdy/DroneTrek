## Summary
Fast and reliable, solution oriented package for monitoring water quality in urban and suburban water bodies using drone technology.

## Description
We propose user-oriented and multi-faceted service package based on aerial spatial monitoring using drones, targeted towards both individual users and larger entities such as municipalities and other private users.

We offer water quality evaluation of natural water bodies. Our drones would be employed to monitor Baltic Sea and Finnish water bodies for algal blooms, oil or chemical spills. In addition, our drones are equipped to perform automated water sampling to a programmed GPS location.

The application allows rapid data collection and remote access; it can be performed in conditions when target locations are difficult to access (such as remote water bodies), dangerous (biohazard risk) or expensive (aerial monitoring using helicopters). The applicationâ€™s versatility and user-friendliness is estimated to improve over time using a feedback loop from the users.
